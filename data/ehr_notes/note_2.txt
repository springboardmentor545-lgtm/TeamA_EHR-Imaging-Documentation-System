History Of Presenting Illness
mediastinitis and persistent Group B Streptococcus (GBS) and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA) bacteremia. Onset: The patient initially presented to the outside hospital on ___ with a 6-day
history of generalized malaise, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and intermittent chest discomfort. Location:
The patient was found to have a large fluid collection in the mediastinum at the sternotomy site, with
concern for extension to the pericardium. Duration: Symptoms had been present for approximately 6 days
prior to initial presentation. Character: The patient reported generalized malaise and chest discomfort.
Alleviating/Aggravating Factors: Not specified in the provided information. Radiation: The mediastinal fluid
collection was noted to potentially extend to the pericardium. Timing: Symptoms were persistent for 6
days before seeking medical attention. Severity: Not explicitly stated, but the presence of bacteremia and
mediastinitis suggests a severe condition. Associated Symptoms: The patient experienced nausea,
vomiting, and diarrhea in addition to the primary complaints. At the outside hospital, the patient was
found to be bacteremic, growing both GBS and MRSA in blood cultures. Imaging studies, including a CT
chest, revealed a large fluid collection in the mediastinum with concern for extension to the pericardium

Liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, kidneys, ureters, and small bowel
unremarkable. Gallbladder surgically absent. Common bile duct not dilated,
Abdomen consistent with post-cholecystectomy change. No mesenteric or retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy. No abnormal fluid collection. Mesenteric vessels enhance
normally for non-CTA technique.
Rectum, uterus, and bladder appear unremarkable. Short segment of colon
(splenic flexure) demonstrates bowel wall thickening, submucosal edema, and
Pelvis
mild adjacent inflammatory change. Diverticulosis of colon noted, but no
inflamed diverticulum identified. No free air or free fluid.
