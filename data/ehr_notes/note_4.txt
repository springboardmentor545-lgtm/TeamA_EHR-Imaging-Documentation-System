ongoing chills/rigors, sweats, and worsening left calf swelling and left foot pain.
History Of Present Illness
44-year-old male with PMH of DM (A1C 7.4%), Psoriatic Arthritis on Etanercept, CAD s/p stent, presents to the ED with chief complaint of worsening
left foot ulcer/cellulitis, ongoing chills/rigors, sweats, and left calf swelling. HPI: Patient reports onset of a blister on the lateral aspect of his left foot
near the MTP joint approximately 6-8 weeks ago. He attributes this to new sandals. The blister opened a few weeks later, and patient reports ocean
water exposure with the open wound. Shortly after, he developed swelling and pain in his left foot, accompanied by chills, shaking rigors, and
profuse night sweats. Pain progressed from the foot to the left calf. Patient was admitted to [Hospital] about 2 weeks ago for a 4-day course of IV
antibiotics (Vancomycin confirmed, possibly Ciprofloxacin). Wound cultures reportedly grew 'Staph and Strep.' He was discharged on PO
Clindamycin, but symptoms worsened after discontinuation of IV antibiotics. Patient saw a surgeon yesterday who recommended return to [Hospital],
recommended admission for IV antibiotics and MRI. In the ED, patient received 1500mg IV Vancomycin. Onset: ~6-8 weeks ago Location: Left foot,
progressing to left calf Duration: Ongoing for several weeks, worsening recently Character: Pain, swelling, associated with systemic symptoms
Alleviating/Aggravating Factors: Worsened after switching from IV to PO antibiotics Radiation: From foot to calf Timing: Progressive Severity: Not
specified, but significant enough to seek emergency care Associated Symptoms: Chills, rigors, night sweats Review of Systems: General: Positive for
chills, rigors, night sweats Respiratory: Denies SOB or cough Cardiovascular: H/o CAD s/p stent, denies chest pain Musculoskeletal: Left foot pain and
swelling, left calf swelling Neurological: Alert and oriented, no focal deficits noted Endocrine: H/o DM with recent A1C 7.4% Psychiatric: No acute
