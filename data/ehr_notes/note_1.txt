History Of Presenting Illness
Mr. Stephen Porter, a 57-year-old male with a history of ESRD on home HD, thyroid cancer, HTN, lumbar
spondylosis with radiculopathy, and CAD s/p CABG, presents with severe low back pain and inability to
ambulate. Chief Complaint: Low back pain and inability to walk. Onset: Patient reports onset of symptoms
approximately one month ago following a motor vehicle accident where he was rear-ended. The pain
acutely worsened recently, prompting him to contact his PCP's office on the day of presentation. Location:
Low back with radiation down the back of both legs. Duration: One month, with acute exacerbation.
Character: Patient describes the pain as sharp and shooting. Alleviating/Aggravating Factors: Pain is
exacerbated by movement and attempts to ambulate. Alleviating factors are not clearly identified.
Radiation: Pain radiates down the back of both legs. Timing: Constant pain with recent acute worsening.
Severity: Severe enough to impair ambulation, suggesting 9-10/10 on pain scale. Associated Symptoms:
Patient denies bowel or bladder incontinence, saddle anesthesia, fever, or chills. He reports significant
spinal tenderness and weakness in the lower extremities, being unable to stand or walk without a cane. In
the ED, the patient was noted to be hypertensive with BP up to 200s/90s, likely due to pain and missed HD
session.

sequences in multiple planes.
Findings
Alignment Normal lumbar lordosis maintained. No spondylolisthesis.
Normal vertebral body heights. No compression fractures or bone marrow
Vertebralbodies

Severe disc height loss at L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels. Moderate disc desiccation at

these levels.
Severe central canal stenosis at L4-L5 due to a combination of disc bulge, facet
Spinalcanal hypertrophy, and ligamentum flavum thickening. Moderate central canal stenosis
at L5-S1.
Neuralforamina Severe bilateral neural foraminal narrowing at L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels.
Nerveroots Bilateral L4 and L5 nerve root compression noted.
Facetjoints Severe facet joint arthropathy at L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels.
ParavertebralsofttissueNso abnormal paravertebral soft tissue masses or collections.
Impression
1. Severe spinal stenosis at L4-L5 level with bilateral L4 nerve root compression.
2. Moderate to severe spinal stenosis at L5-S1 level with bilateral L5 nerve root compression.
3. Severe facet joint arthropathy at L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels.

4. No evidence of acute fracture, infection, or malignancy.
Conclusion
Findings consistent with severe degenerative changes in the lower lumbar spine, most pronounced at L4-
L5 and L5-S1 levels, resulting in severe spinal stenosis and nerve root compression. These findings
correlate with the patient's symptoms of low back pain and radiculopathy.

Reason For Admission
Mr. Porter, a 57-year-old male with a history of ESRD on home HD, thyroid cancer, HTN, lumbar
spondylosis with radiculopathy, and CAD s/p CABG, was admitted due to severe low back pain and
inability to ambulate. The pain began one month ago following a motor vehicle accident and acutely
worsened prior to admission.
Hospital Course
During his 5-day stay, Mr. Porter underwent evaluation and treatment for acute exacerbation of chronic
lumbar radiculopathy. Key events included: 1. MRI of the lumbar spine revealed severe spinal stenosis at
15mg daily for better BP control. 5. Neurosurgery consultation: Recommended conservative
throughout the stay, progressing from being unable to ambulate to walking short distances with a walker.
Primary

Activity Restrictions
Gradually increase activity as tolerated. Use walker for ambulation. Avoid heavy lifting or strenuous
activities.
Dietary Recommendations
