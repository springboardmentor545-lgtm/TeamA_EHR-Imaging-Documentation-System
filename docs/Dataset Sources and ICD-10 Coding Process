# Dataset Sources and ICD-10 Coding Process

## Source
The dataset combines chest X-ray and CT scan records annotated with diagnosis text.

## ICD-10 Mapping Process
1. Each record includes:  
   - Filename  
   - Modality (X-ray / CT)  
   - Diagnosis text  
   - ICD-10 code  

2. Mapping steps:  
   - Diagnosis text was standardized (normalized casing and spelling).  
   - ICD-10 codes were assigned using WHO ICD-10 guidelines.  
   - For ambiguous cases, the most appropriate generalized ICD-10 category was used.  
   - All entries were validated for consistency.  

3. Output:  
   - Final dataset stored at **`data/mapping.csv`**.  
   - Reference codes documented in **`docs/icd10_mapping_notes.md`**.  

## Structure
- `data/mapping.csv` → Cleaned dataset with ICD-10 codes.  
- `docs/icd10_mapping_notes.md` → Justification for chosen ICD-10 codes.  
- `docs/dataset_sources.md` → Process documentation.
