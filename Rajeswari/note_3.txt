Admission
History Of Present Illness
47-year-old male presents to the ED following a fall down 15 stairs. HPI: Patient was found unresponsive at the scene after falling down
approximately 15 stairs. The exact time of onset is unknown, but EMS was called immediately upon discovery. The incident occurred at the patient's
home. Duration of unconsciousness is unclear. The nature of the injury is blunt trauma, likely involving multiple body systems. Aggravating factors
include movement and stimulation. There are no known alleviating factors at this time. The severity is critical, given the patient's low GCS score and
need for intubation. On arrival to the ED, patient's GCS was 7 (E1V1M5), indicating severe impairment of consciousness. Due to his low GCS and
inability to protect his airway, the patient was intubated. Bilateral bleeding from the ears was noted, raising concern for basilar skull fracture. Review
of Systems: General: Unresponsive, intubated. Respiratory: On mechanical ventilation, unable to assess spontaneous respiratory effort.
Cardiovascular: Unable to obtain due to patient's condition. Musculoskeletal: Full extent of injuries unknown pending further examination and
imaging. Neurological: GCS 7 on arrival, pupils equal and reactive to light, bleeding from ears bilaterally. Endocrine: Unable to assess due to
patient's condition. Psychiatric: Unable to assess due to patient's condition. Patient remains critically ill, requiring full trauma evaluation and

Discharge Summary
Patient Information
Medical Record Number
Reason For Admission
47-year-old male admitted for severe traumatic brain injury with suspected basilar skull fracture after falling down approximately 15 stairs at home.
Patient was found unresponsive with a GCS of 7 on arrival to the ED.
Hospital Course
Patient was intubated in the ED due to low GCS and inability to protect airway. CT scans revealed bilateral longitudinal temporal bone fractures and
patient received mechanical ventilation, seizure prophylaxis, and DVT prophylaxis. Over the course of three days, the patient showed slight
improvement in neurological status, with GCS improving from 3T to 6T (E4VTM1). ICP remained controlled throughout the hospital stay.
Severe traumatic brain injury
Bilateral longitudinal temporal bone fractures
Diffuse axonal injury
Bilateral hemotympanum
Levetiracetam As prescribed Intravenous Twice daily
Follow Up Plans
Follow up with Neurosurgery in 1-2 weeks
Schedule appointment with Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation within 1 month
Audiology assessment within 2 weeks
Continue inpatient rehabilitation as determined by the rehabilitation team
Discharge Instructions
Monitor for signs of increased intracranial pressure (severe headache, vomiting, decreased level of consciousness)
Follow speech and swallowing therapy recommendations
Adhere to physical and occupational therapy exercise regimens
Avoid strenuous activities and follow activity restrictions as advised by the rehabilitation team
Return to the Emergency Department if experiencing worsening neurological symptoms, fever, or signs of infection
Additional Notes
Patient requires ongoing intensive rehabilitation
Long-term prognosis remains guarded; family has been counseled on potential outcomes
Consider outpatient neuropsychological evaluation once medically stable
Hearing assessment and follow-up recommended due to temporal bone fractures
Patient may require long-term care and support; social work has been involved for resource planning
