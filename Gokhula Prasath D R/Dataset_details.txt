**About Dataset**

The Multi‑Modal Heart CT & MRI Dataset is a structured and research‑ready simulation of the original COROSCAN dataset, which consists of over 20,000 DICOM files covering 150 anonymized patients. This synthetic dataset is designed for machine learning, deep learning, and medical imaging research, especially in multi‑modal heart analysis tasks.
