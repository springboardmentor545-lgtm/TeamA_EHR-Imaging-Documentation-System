      "Patient presented to the Emergency Department with a several-week history of progressively worsening headaches, associated with nausea and occasional vomiting. Over the past few days, the patient also developed new-onset right-sided weakness and expressive aphasia. There was no prior history of neurological deficits or brain injury. Family reported changes in personality and cognition.

      "   CT Brain (without and with contrast): Performed on admission, revealed a large, irregularly shaped, heterogeneously enhancing mass measuring approximately 5.0 x 4.5 x 4.8 cm within the left frontal lobe. Significant surrounding vasogenic edema was noted, causing a 6 mm left-to-right midline shift and compression of the left lateral ventricle. No acute hemorrhage or hydrocephalus was evident.\n",
      "   MRI Brain (with and without contrast, including spectroscopy and perfusion): Performed following the CT scan for further characterization. Confirmed the left frontal lobe mass, demonstrating central necrosis, patchy enhancement, and significant peritumoral edema. Diffusion-weighted imaging showed restricted diffusion within solid components of the mass. Perfusion imaging indicated high relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) within the enhancing portions. MR Spectroscopy revealed an elevated choline-to-creatine ratio and markedly decreased N-acetylaspartate (NAA), highly suggestive of a high-grade malignant glial neoplasm. There was suspicion of extension into the corpus callosum.\n",

      "Hospital Course:\n",
      "Following urgent neurological assessment and advanced imaging, the patient was admitted to the Med-Surg ICU post-operatively. Neurosurgical consultation was obtained immediately upon imaging findings. Given the highly suspicious radiological features, the patient underwent an urgent stereotactic brain biopsy, which confirmed a diagnosis of Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), WHO Grade IV. The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate post-operative complications. Post-biopsy, the patient remained stable with ongoing supportive care, including corticosteroids for cerebral edema. A multidisciplinary tumor board discussion outlined a treatment plan involving adjuvant radiation therapy and concomitant temozolomide chemotherapy. The patient and family were educated on the diagnosis and proposed treatment strategy.\n",
