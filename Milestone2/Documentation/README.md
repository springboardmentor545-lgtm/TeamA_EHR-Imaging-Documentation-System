ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on enhancing medical images (MRI, CT, X-ray) using Generative AI and classical deep learning models. The goal is to improve image clarity, denoise scans, and provide healthcare professionals with diagnostic-quality visuals.

Milestone 2 covers implementation, experimentation, and evaluation of image enhancement techniques.

âœ… Steps Completed in Milestone 2
1. Dataset Preparation

Collected MRI, CT, and X-ray images.

Selected ~20â€“50 images for testing enhancement.

2. Preprocessing

Standardized formats: .png, resized to 256x256.

Normalized pixel values to range 0.0 â€“ 1.0.

Created train/test split.

3. Enhancement Techniques Applied

Classical Deep Models: DnCNN, EDSR, SRCNN.

Generative AI-based: API-based denoising & upscaling.

OpenCV Methods: Backup sharpening & noise reduction.

4. Validation

Compared before vs. after images.

Metrics used: PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio), SSIM (Structural Similarity Index).

Results stored in /Results folder.

5. Challenges Faced

Slow CPU training â†’ shifted to Colab GPU.

Some models produced blurry outputs.

Handling large result sets (~100 images) was difficult.

Used OpenCV methods when deep models underperformed.

ðŸ“Š Results

Enhanced images show better clarity and sharpness.

Visual evaluation proved more reliable than metrics (due to limited ground-truth HQ images).

Hybrid approach (Classical + GenAI) achieved the best overall results.
