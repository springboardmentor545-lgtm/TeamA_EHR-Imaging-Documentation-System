Milestone 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing

ðŸ“Œ Objective

The goal of this milestone is to collect, organize, and preprocess medical imaging and clinical (EHR) data to prepare it for downstream AI/GenAI model training and applications.
________________________________________
ðŸ“‚ Tasks Completed

1. Data Collection

â€¢	Medical Imaging Datasets

o	Collected openly available datasets: X-ray, MRI, CT, Ultrasound, DXA

o	Sources: Kaggle, PhysioNet, NIH, and other open repositories.

â€¢	Electronic Health Records (EHR)

o	Gathered structured data: demographics, vitals, lab test results, coded values (ICD/CPT).

o	Gathered unstructured data: patient notes, discharge summaries, and free-text reports.

________________________________________

2. Preprocessing

â€¢	Cleaning

o	Removed duplicates and noisy/unreadable samples.

o	Standardized missing values and normalized units.

â€¢	Labeling

o	Created mappings between imaging samples and corresponding patient metadata.

o	Annotated EHR notes with structured labels (e.g., diagnosis codes, conditions).

â€¢	Standardization

o	Converted images into a uniform format (.png, .jpg, .nii).

o	Tokenized and standardized text data for GenAI compatibility (UTF-8, lowercasing, de-identification).

o	Ensured compliance with privacy and de-identification protocols (HIPAA/GDPR safe).
